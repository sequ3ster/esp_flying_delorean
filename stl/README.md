You need to print the "Wall rear", "EQ Front" and one of the EQ defuser. "EQ-defuser-ams.stl" or 7x "EQ-defuser.stl".
In the AMS version, each LED has its own defuser. These are then separated by a different Filament Color.
You will also find a Bambu Studio file “EQ-Mod.3mf” with 4 printing plates.
